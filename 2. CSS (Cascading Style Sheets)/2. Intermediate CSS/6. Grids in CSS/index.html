    <h1>CSS Grids</h1>

    <h4>A grid container is an HTML element that defines a grid layout. To control the layout of the grid items within the container, various CSS properties can be applied to the container itself.</h4>

    <p>display property is set to "grid" to define the container as a grid container. Its initial value is "block".</p>

    <p>The child elements inside the grid container are known as grid items.</p>

    <p>grid-template-columns: Using this rule, we will be able to define the number of columns in the CSS grid and along with that we can also specify the size of each column. The size of each column can be different and can be mentioned in different units as well.</p>

    <p>grid-auto-flow: Using this rule, we will be able to control the flow of the grid items. Its initial value is "row".</p>

    <p>grid-template-rows: Using this rule, we will be able to define the number of rows in the CSS grid and along with that we can also specify the size of each row.</p>

    <div id="container">

        <div class="item">1</div>

        <div class="item">2</div>

        <div class="item">3</div>

        <div class="item">4</div>

        <div class="item">5</div>

        <div class="item">6</div>

        <div class="item">7</div>

        <div class="item">8</div>
        
    </div>

    <h4>To make sure that we are able to provide the grid configuration in CSS properly, we can use a couple of utility functions.</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>repeat(): If we want to give the number of rows or columns in a shortcut way, we can use this function. It takes two values: the number of times and the value we want to repeat.</li>

        <br>

        <li>minmax(): If we want to specify the minimum and maximum size of each column or row, we can use this function. It takes two values: the minimum size and the maximum size.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>grid-template-areas: Using this rule, we will be able to specify the grid areas. Its initial value is "none".</p>
