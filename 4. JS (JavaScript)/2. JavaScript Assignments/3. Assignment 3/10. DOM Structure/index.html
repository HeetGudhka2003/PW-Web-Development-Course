<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DOM Structure</title>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- 
    
    The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a webpage as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML document is a node in the DOM tree. This hierarchical structure allows scripts and programs to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and styling of the webpage dynamically.

    Root Node: The top-level node of the DOM tree is the <html> element.

    Element Nodes: Represent HTML tags, such as <head>, <body>, <div> etc.

    Text Nodes: Represent the text content inside elements.

    Attribute Nodes: Represent attributes like id, class, or src as part of element nodes.
