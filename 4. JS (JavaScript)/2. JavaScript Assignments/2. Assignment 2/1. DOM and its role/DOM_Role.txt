1. Explain the DOM and its role in Web development.

Ans: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents, representing the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. Each element, attribute, and text is a node in this tree, allowing developers to access and manipulate content, structure, and styling via scripting languages like JavaScript. The DOM's dynamic nature enables the creation of interactive web pages by modifying elements in response to user actions or events. In web development, it plays a crucial role in enabling dynamic updates, form validation, animations, and real-time data rendering without reloading the entire page.
